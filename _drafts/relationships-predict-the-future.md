## I can predict **your** future.

I'm not a psychic, I'm a pastor, and I don't need any special gifts to do this.

How is this possible without some supernatural ability?

**I just need to know who is influencing you.**

The goal of this message is:

1. To show you how powerful relationships (influences) are in the grand scheme of your life.
2. To show you the types of influences and their potential outcomes.
3. To help you figure out what you can (and should) do about them.

### The power of relationships.

Relationships ultimately boil down to one thing: influence.

**The closer the relationship, the greater the influence**.

Think about it, who has greater influence (for better or for worse) in your life: your mother or the grocery clerk? Your spouse, or your mailman? Your favorite author, musician, athlete, or the high school librarian?

Not all relationships have to be mutually agreed upon to determine their influence. A relationship is determined by how **you** relate to another person. If I asked you who your best friend is, and then ask your best friend who their best friend is, it may or may not be you.

In that case, you are more than likely being influenced more by your "best friend" than they are being influenced by you. This is because in _your_ mind, it is a closer relationship.

You probably know your high school librarian more than your favorite author, musician, or athlete. I still know quite a bit about my high school librarian, after having known who she was for several years, and spending a considerable amount of time in the same room as her during those years (at least a couple hours a week).

On the contrary my favorite author, I'll say is the apostle Paul who wrote nearly 2/3's of the new testament and lived about 2,000 years before me. Due to the current time travel restrictions, I've never been able to meet him.

Despite how long I knew my high school librarian, and how much time I spent in the same room as her, she has had no impact on my life. She expressed no interest in my life, other than how much noise I made in her sacred hall and I had no interest in her life.

It's interesting that I regard my librarian who worked with books her whole life, and the apostle Paul who wrote books, completely differently. This goes back to the way that I relate to these two different people. Both of them worked with books, and yet only one of them had a significant impact on my life.

Therefore, how you relate to somebody, will make you feel closer to or distant from that person, and this is what determines their influence on your life.

How I relate to somebody then becomes extremely important. The closer I am to somebody, the more that they will influence me. 

Look at this scripture:

1 Corinthians 15:33 Do not be deceived: “Evil company corrupts good habits.”

Depending on your translation, "habits" might be replaced by: morals, character, or manners.

#### The implication is clear, people that are bad influences will ruin who I am.

The opposite of this may also be true: good company will produce good habits, morals, character, or manners.

This brings us to the second point:

### The two types of influences.

Within every relationship there is influence. It may lean more to one side of the relationship than the other, but it's always there to some degree. You might be influencing that person more than they are influencing you, or vice versa. You may be mutually influencing each other.

That influence is either pushing you forward and helping you, or it is pulling you backwards. The closer you are to that person (the more you relate to them) the more evident that influence becomes.
