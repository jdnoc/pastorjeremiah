## I can predict **your** future.

I'm not a psychic, I'm a pastor, and I don't need any special gifts to do this.

How is this possible without some supernatural ability?

**I just need to know who is influencing you.**

The goal of this message is:

1.  To show you how powerful relationships (influences) are in the grand scheme of your life. 
2. To show you the types of influences and their potential outcomes. 
3. To help you figure out what you can (and should) do about them.

### The power of relationships.

Relationships ultimately boil down to one thing: influence. **The closer the relationship, the greater the influence**.

Think about it, who has greater influence (for better or for worse) in your life: your mother or the grocery clerk? Your spouse, or your mailman? Your favorite author, musician, athlete, or the high school librarian?

Not all relationships have to be mutually agreed upon to determine their influence. A relationship is determined by how **you** relate to another person. If I asked you who your best friend is, and then ask your best friend who their best friend is, it may or may not be you.

In that case, you are more than likely being influenced more by your "best friend" than they are being influenced by you. This is because in your mind, it is a closer relationship.

Take that last example into consideration. You probably know your high school librarian more than your favorite author, musician, or athlete. I still know quite a bit about my high school librarian, after having known who she was for several years, and spending a considerable amount of time in the same room as her during those years (at least a couple hours a week). 

On the contrary my favorite author, I'll say is the apostle Paul who wrote nearly 2/3's of the new testament, lived about 2,000 years before me. Due to the current time travel restrictions, I've never been able to meet him.

My high school librarian, despite how long I knew her and was around her, has had no impact on my life. (Besides forming in me the belief that librarians like their job because they don't have to talk to people and that people in turn don't like to talk to them) Sorry if you're a librarian, that probably doesn't describe you, you're probably a great person!

Yet the apostle Paul, whom I have never met, has had a drastic impact on my life. I feel as if I do know him personally though that couldn't be possible. He has an impact on my life, because of the way that I **relate** to him.

Therefore, how you relate to somebody else, will make you feel closer to or distant from that person, and this is what determines their influence on your life.

Take the example of your mother and the grocery clerk.

Though I would hope this doesn't apply to anybody reading this, imagine you have had a terrible relationship with your mother. In turn, you want to be nothing like her
