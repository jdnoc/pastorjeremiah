### Bible Verses About Music

Psalm 95: Oh come, let us sing to the Lord! Let us shout joyfully to the Rock of our salvation.

Psalm 100:1-5 Make a joyful shout to the Lord, all you lands! 2 Serve the Lord with gladness; Come before His presence with singing. 3 Know that the Lord, He is God; It is He who has made us, and \[b\]not we ourselves; We are His people and the sheep of His pasture. 4 Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, And into His courts with praise. Be thankful to Him, and bless His name. 5 For the Lord is good; His mercy is everlasting, And His truth endures to all generations.

Psalm 104:33 I will sing to the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.

Psalm 150:1 Praise the Lord! Praise God in His sanctuary; Praise Him in His mighty firmament! 2 Praise Him for His mighty acts; Praise Him according to His excellent greatness! 3 Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet; Praise Him with the lute and harp! 4 Praise Him with the timbrel and dance; Praise Him with stringed instruments and flutes! 5 Praise Him with loud cymbals; Praise Him with clashing cymbals! 6 Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!

Colossians 3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

James 5:13 Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms.

Ephesians 5:19 speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,

Philippians 4:8 Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate on these things.

1 Corinthians 15:33 Do not be deceived: “Evil company corrupts good habits.”

Romans 12:2 And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

Ephesians 5:10 finding out what is acceptable to the Lord. 11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them.

Romans 8:8 So then, those who are in the flesh cannot please God.

Colossians 3:23 And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men

#### If you read all the scriptures above, then you can clearly see that God is a loves music.

Not only singing, but music with instruments as well. Some Christians claim that we shouldn’t use electrical instruments because they aren’t mentioned in the Bible. Pants aren’t mentioned in the Bible either, should we go back to wearing a toga? _Don’t make ridiculous doctrines out of nothing._

God has clearly put an emphasis on praise and worship in His word. In my own life, many of the most powerful experiences that I’ve had with God have been while I was worshiping Him.

I don’t sing well, and I don’t currently play any instruments. That doesn’t matter. **What matters is our heart in worship**. That we bring a sacrifice of praise. That we bless God with all of our heart as we sing and make music to Him.

That being said, I won’t be talking about how to worship God with music for the rest of this post. Like I said, I’m not a good singer or musician. You can find worship leaders with God’s anointing on their life and get instruction from them on the subject.

What I want to deal with in this article is:

# The Negative Side Of Music

There are all kinds of music in this world and with the way technology is, it’s getting easier and easier to listen to it. What we listen to has a huge impact on us.

Of course there are many positive attributes to listening to music. But what about the negative ones? Perhaps you haven’t ever carefully evaluated the songs you listen to, and what their effect is on you.

#### When you listen to music, one of the biggest questions you should ask yourself is: what impact is it having on me?

Some songs have a catchy beat, so you listen to it over and over. You might not care about the words - but whether you like it or not - those words are going into your soul.

You might think I’m about to go off on secular music. I will, but...

### First let me go off on Christian music

There are many songs and musicians that fall under the “Christian” genre. Today you can’t just assume that because something is called "christian" that is good to listen to. Some of the most detrimental songs out there are Christian ones.

Why is that?

If  you have christian radio on, or you heard a song from church - whether it’s your church - or one on youtube. Generally speaking - _we let our guard down_. Rightfully so - we shouldn’t be guarded against trusted worship leaders.

**Yet we shouldn’t be oblivious to what we are singing**. There are plenty of Christian songs out there from all genres that have enough doubt in them to put Thomas to shame. If you are singing songs that are full of doubt and negativity, how is that pleasing to God?

##### You need to know what you are singing - if the lyrics are charged with faith and God's anointing, or something else.

**Many Christian songs deal with the soul realm - not the spirit realm**. They deal with feelings - not with the Word.

Something that you will have to understand if you want to be a successful and productive Christian is that God is moved by faith, not emotion. See Hebrews 11:6 for details.

###### Singing songs that make you feel emotional don’t necessarily mean that they are good songs.

We should be singing songs that glorify God. The term “praise and worship” implies that that’s what we are doing. Praising and worshiping God. Not singing about our struggles. **WE shouldn’t be the focal point of any worship song, HE should be.**

What business do you have singing songs that are about what you used to be before you got saved. If you are born again, then you’ve been washed with the blood of Jesus and you’re not a sinner any more. Singing that you’re a wretched sinner is a direct contradiction to scripture.

If you are a wretched sinner, then get saved and stop singing about it.

Our songs that we sing are important. **They should be based in good biblical doctrine, not personal experience.**

Christian songs should inspire us to praise and worship Him. They should lead us into God’s presence, by causing us to become hungry for His Spirit. If the songs you listen to are called Christian, but you’re not getting those results, _maybe it’s time to put on a different song_.

### If you are saved, and feel like listening to secular music is totally fine...

Then scroll back to the top of this post and read these verses: Philippians 4:8, 1 Corinthians 15:33, Romans 12:2, Ephesians 5:10-11, Romans 8:8, Colossians 3:23

Most secular music is full of trash. It’s difficult to find secular music that is wholesome. When is the last time you listened to worldly music that anything good came from it?

Sex, violence, vulgarity, sad stories, bad morals; this is what you’ll find in most secular music. How do listen to that and not think that it will cause problems for you down the road?

If we are to do everything as unto the Lord, not as unto men - like Colossians 3:23 says we are, **then how do we listen to filth as unto the Lord?**

Maybe the reason you think about cheating on your spouse is because that’s what the songs you listen to are singing about. Or is it drugs and/or alcohol that you can’t seem to escape, yet the music you listen to is full of references to it.

#### If you wouldn’t do what those songs are singing about, then why would you listen to them?
