Before I go into a lot of details about starting a church, I want to tell you about me. I don’t want to tell you about me because I think I’m something special. In fact, by the time you are done reading this, you will realize just how ordinary I am.

God doesn’t need you to be a superstar, naturally speaking. He is able to take somebody that is ordinary and cause them to do something extraordinary. This has happened with people that God has used throughout the entire Bible.

Please understand that I’m not writing about me because I love to talk about me. One of my greatest hesitations about writing this, or even going into ministry, is that I felt so unremarkable.

When I read about the wonderful things that men and women of God have done through the centuries, I have always felt they were people larger than life. They must be people with powerful natural capabilities.

Being aware of how normal I am, I felt like I didn’t have much to offer people. A thought like that can (and often does) stop you from doing something big for God.

Those men and women that God used to do incredible things through- most, if not all, claimed to be very ordinary. One woman minister in particular that I read about shook entire cities with the power of God. Miracles so powerful were done through her ministry that even the most devout doubters turned to God.

Near the end of her ministry when she was asked about her life, she would describe herself as the most ordinary individual.

In order to do anything worth doing in ministry, you have to realize that it is God who does amazing things. We are just the vessels that he uses to do them through. This is very humbling and amazing at the same time.

One of the first things you have to do to start ministry isn’t what you would think. It’s not getting a non-profit incorporation put together. It’s not picking a strategic location. It’s not finding a building or getting people involved.

It’s getting over yourself.

You have to come to the point where you no longer think about only you and your best interest. Jesus said that to become the greatest of all, you have to become the servant of all. So if you are going into ministry with lofty ideas about how great you are, you better pause for a minute.

Having a large ego hasn’t been much of a problem for me. The opposite, on the other hand, lack of confidence was my struggle.

As I said before, I always felt very ordinary. I wasn’t a compelling preacher. Actually, when I started preaching- if I had to sit through one of my own sermons, I probably would have walked out on myself.

A practical exercise to do that helps you preach better is to record your sermon and listen to it later. I was so bad that I couldn’t handle listening to myself more than a minute before I would get annoyed and turn off the recording.

I’m not saying that I didn’t have a passion for the things of God. After all, that is what kept me going in the ministry. What I mean is that I didn’t feel my natural abilities were capable of performing what God had put in my heart.

I had a big vision to start a church that would change the region I live in but didn’t feel like I would be able to do it.

This happened to Moses when God called him to deliver His people out of Egypt. Moses insisted that he didn’t have the speaking ability to do it, so he God Aaron to speak for him.

Fortunately for me, I didn’t have somebody like Aaron that I could depend on. I say fortunately because I see now that if I had somebody else to depend on to preach, I probably wouldn’t be a pastor of a church today. If I wasn’t forcing myself to preach, it could have taken years of slowly building my speaking skills I would have built up the confidence to preach and become a pastor.

Thankfully I forced myself, despite myself, to preach.
