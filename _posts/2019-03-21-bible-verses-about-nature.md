### Bible Verses About Nature

Genesis 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

John 1:3 All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made.

Psalm 95:4 In His hand are the deep places of the earth; The heights of the hills are His also. 5 The sea is His, for He made it; And His hands formed the dry land.

Acts 4:24 So when they heard that, they raised their voice to God with one accord and said: “Lord, You are God, who made heaven and earth and the sea, and all that is in them,

Jeremiah 27:5 ‘I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are on the ground, by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and have given it to whom it seemed proper to Me

Isaiah 45:12 I have made the earth, and created man on it. I—My hands—stretched out the heavens, And all their host I have commanded.

Psalm 89:11 The heavens are Yours, the earth also is Yours; The world and all its fullness, You have founded them.

Hebrews 11:3 By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible.

#### I grew up where the wildlife outnumbered the human population, a place known as the middle of nowhere. 

My wife grew up in a suburb in Pennsylvania. Ever since we got married, Julia tells me how much there is to do in the city, I always argue how little there is to do in the city and explain all the things to do in the country.

Growing up I often wondered what life would be like to live “in town”. The towns I was referring to had about 2,000-5,000 people living in them. Then I went to Bible college in a suburb of Tampa Fl. I didn’t realize how small those towns were that I had imagined living in until I moved back from the city. Driving through a town of 2,000 people with no stoplight on main street didn’t feel like a town anymore, more like a gathering people that decided to live slightly closer together.

I’ve always felt drawn to nature, but even more so after living in a city suburb. Whenever I get a chance, I spend time outside (preferably hunting in my woods) and enjoy God’s creation.

Living close to nature made it seem obvious to me that God created the world we live in. Yet that’s not what I was taught in public school, and outside of church that’s not what everybody believed.

How does something that seems so obvious to me, be considered to be a complete insult to much of the scientific world?

If you found this article because you searched the internet for Bible verses about nature, then you’re probably curious about what God and nature have to do with each other. Maybe you’re wondering if God created nature, or if it “happened” by chance. That’s what I’ll be discussing in this article.

Today there are two primary thought processes on this subject:

# Scientific Theory vs. Intelligent Design

### The scientific theory of how earth and the universe was created is the big bang theory.

You’d have to go back about 14 billion years when nothing existed to see it happen. The BBC describes it [here](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140812-how-was-the-universe-created).

Let me give you a simple summary of what that article says. Somehow energy turned into particles, and then after about 700,000 years these particles exploded and turned into stuff which eventually turned into stars, planets, solar systems and all of what we call the universe.

That sounds pretty cool. If you add a bunch of fancy scientific names to it - it almost makes sense. Almost… but not really. Actually, not really at all. I don’t see how such smart people that have studied our world and the universe couldn’t come up with something a little more convincing.

##### Nothing turned into something, which created everything??

As crazy is it sounds - _that’s how Christians believe the world was formed as well_. I’ll come back to this in a moment.

The big bang theory doesn’t answer the question of how humans and life forms were created. That requires a little more complex thinking. The particles and specks that turned into planets eventually coagulated into micro organisms which eventually evolved into all the different plants, animals, and all things living that exist today. Of course that took billions of years to happen.

It seems like the common scientific answer for the difficult questions about creation is that **by saying something took billions of years to happen**, _it makes sense_.

### Intelligent design believes that a supreme being created our world and the universe we live in.

Christianity and the Bible make that pretty clear right from the get go.

> Genesis 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

Genesis 1 gives us the description of the way that God created the heavens, the earth, and all that is within them.

Human reason struggles with this idea, because it goes against today’s logic. Then again you have to ask yourself, does today’s logic make any more sense than believing that God created everything. Does it require any less faith to believe the logic of the big bang theory?

Science doesn’t create anything, rather it discovers what God already created. For example, scientists didn’t create gravity, electricity, or DNA, they just discovered them.

In a sense, I don’t think the scientists are far off with their big bang theory. I think they just don’t have the reason or the timing down for it.

##### It didn't take billions of years to happen, it only took a moment. It didn’t happen randomly, rather it was a definite act of purpose.

Let me explain:

> Hebrews 11:3 By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible.

If you you look at that verse with the first few verses in Genesis:

> 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. 3 Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day. 6 Then God said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” 7 Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so.

In a moment of time, God spoke and created light. In another moment He spoke and created the earth. If you read through the whole first chapter of Genesis, you will see that this is how God created our world and the whole universe.

###### God spoke and suddenly there was creation. There was nothing, then suddenly, there was something.

The scientific theory agrees with this - it discovered this - that creation suddenly happened. Yet where science can’t give you a reason as to why this happened - _Christianity can._

God created the universe, and put us in it, because he wanted to have fellowship.

> Genesis 1:26 Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness…

God created us to be like Him. God has freedom of choice, and so do we. He wanted us to choose Him.

God already had angels. Angels are servants, though they have the ability to make some choices - their purpose is to do as they are told.

Our freedom of choice is why nobody is forced into believing in Jesus. He doesn’t make you serve Him. He desires that you choose Him!

Though God doesn’t want one single person to suffer the penalty of not choosing to have a relationship with Him, He won’t go against our freedom of choice. That’s the way God designed us, to be like Him.

God created earth, the stars and whole universe to give us a wonderful place to live. Why would He go through all that trouble? **Because He loves us**.

When you become a parent you gain a lot of perspective on why God did what he did for us. It’s a joy to have your children love you, to see them choose you.

God didn’t just want employees, he wanted family - that would desire Him.

In the same way a loving father wants to provide a home and good things for his family, God wants to provide for us. What a wonderful creation He has given us to live in and enjoy.

> James 1:17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning.

> Matthew 7:11 So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask him.
