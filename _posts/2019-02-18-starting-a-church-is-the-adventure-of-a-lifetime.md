I’m a minister of the gospel. I’m a husband. I’m a father.

#### My wife and I started a church and it has been the greatest adventure of my life.

I grew up in a Christian family. We attended church every Sunday. I have believed in Jesus for as long as I can remember.

I have made mistakes, learned from them, and moved forward. I love who I am and who God created me to be. I have weaknesses and strengths. Jesus, my wife Julia, and my daughter Zara have teamed up to make me a far greater person than I ever could be on my own.

I have a reserved personality by nature, but I can’t stay away from adventure. Sometimes I can’t decide between going out and exploring a forest, or staying home and reading a book. I love meeting people and hearing about their lives, but I’m also timid in a crowd of people. I get nervous when I’m about to speak to a group of people, but I love the thrill of it.

I started the church because I knew that is what God called me to do. But I had hesitated in doing so because it terrified me at the same time. I am writing this to those of you who have a call of God on your life- but you are unsure about starting.

Why should you listen to me? I’m young, and I don’t have a mega church (yet). There are plenty of ministers out there who have done far more than I have. I read about incredible things that God has done through other ministers to get inspiration. Why don’t you read about them instead of reading about me?

Most ministers wait until they have the big church. Or a move of God that sweeps through a region before they write about it. There’s nothing wrong with doing that.

In fact, it’s good to learn from somebody who has already accomplished big things. At least you know that they did something right!

I’m writing this, not because I have done something great. But rather because I want to help others do something great.

I’m writing this now because I want to write it while I’m in the midst of my journey- not once I’ve already completed it. I want you to see what it’s like to start a church. Not once I’ve already accomplished what I’ve set out to do.

For the record: what I have set out to do is much bigger than anything I can achieve in my own strength. Through God- I will see an entire region come to know who God is.

I’m sure that a lot of the principles that go into starting a church could apply to other types of ministries. Yet I will write about the church that I started since that’s what I know for sure.

Have I done something inspiring? I’ll let you decide. I’m just doing what I do because I want to please God.

> I want to write this in a way that is raw. Unedited in the sense that you will see what it has actually been like starting a church. The pro’s and the con’s, the good and the bad.

I don’t say that to sound weak or discouraging. I like how Paul wrote- he said things very plain. He would talk about the major move of God he was having. Then right after that say how the people chased him out of the city or stoned him.

I’m sure that after Paul got stoned for sharing the gospel he wasn’t telling people about it because he enjoyed it. But he didn’t whine and complain about how hard life was.

#### He was always advancing. Always moving forward. Always taking new ground for the kingdom.

If you read an experience that I have had that might seem like it was tough- it’s not to discourage you. I want you to see the real side of ministry.

In general, if you were to ask me how full-time ministry has been for me, I would say that it has been easy. It’s easy because I love it, and it is what God has called me to do. It has, on the other hand, required some sacrifices.

Let me tell you now, sacrifices that you are willing to make for God won’t only be paid back as blessings in heaven. They will be paid back to you on Earth as well.

> Jesus said that anybody who has given up houses, family, or property for his sake will receive a hundredfold return while we are on Earth! We will also receive the reward in heaven, but that is obvious. Don’t wait until you are in heaven to believe God for good things.

Notice that first comes the sacrificing- then comes the blessing. I have had all that I need since starting the church and even more so now. Yet there have been times where we had little to nothing.

In the times that I had little to nothing- though it was not enjoyable, I knew that my harvest was near. Where I am today in life is much better than it was two and a half years ago when we started the church.

I am confident that in a year from now I will look back at where I am now and see how far God has brought me. In ten years I will look back at this moment and will hardly remember what it is to live like I am. That is because God will have taken me so much further.

#### That’s the way things are when you move with God. He’s always advancing, and so should you.

Come on this journey with me. I’ll show you where I have been, where I am, and where I am going. Hopefully, we will learn something together along the way.
