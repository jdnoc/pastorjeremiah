The Law of God

**Any law is only as effective as the authority that is backing it.**

After I graduated Bible school I spent 6 weeks teaching in a Bible college in Croix-des-Bouquets, Haiti. During my time there I saw that even though there were laws in place, most people simply disregarded them. You would think the police officers there would be constantly busy dealing with these lawbreakers. Yet they weren’t dealing with them, in fact I don’t even remember seeing police officers other than on rare occasions.

The pastor that I was working with told me many horrifying stories of voodoo ceremonies that involved human sacrifices. Voodoo mixed with catholicism is common in Haiti, you might see what appears to be a normal catholic church but inside they are practicing voodoo. The pastor told me stories of witch doctors that would threaten people with curses that if they didn’t bring a certain amount of money to them by a certain day then the curse would kill their entire family. In order to avoid such a curse, people will go mad and do whatever it takes to get the money. Whether they murder somebody or rob a bank, nothing is off the table when they are terrified of a demon possessed witch doctor.

To the average american that has been desensitized by hollywood, or perhaps to somebody that has never travelled to a country like Haiti, it might sound completely far fetched that anything like this takes place today. Farfetched or not, that kind of stuff happens all over in countries like Haiti.

With human sacrificing, witch doctors causing crimes like this - you’d expect the government would shut down such practices. At the very least you’d think the police would be investigating it and protecting people that were involved.

But they don’t. Why?

Corruption. The government is corrupt, the police are corrupt, and therefore the laws meant to protect people are completely ineffective. It’s been a few years since my last trip to Haiti, but I highly doubt that any of this has changed there.

The only organizations that are doing anything effective to change this culture is the church - the real church that preaches the gospel of Jesus Christ.

The pastor told me that when he started the church where he was, the voodoo witch doctors would be out in the streets at night with large crowds of people doing all kinds of strange ceremonies. He didn’t move the church or quit the ministry, he organized all night prayer meetings at his church every week. I went to one of these prayer nights while it was there, it started in the evening while it was still light out and didn’t end until light from the following morning. He told me that once they started doing this on a regular basis that the voodoo ceremonies around his church came to an end and they started getting testimonies of people that were being set free of the cult and had gotten saved.

If the authority that is creating and/or enforcing the law is corrupt, then they will be completely ineffective.

God’s Law

If the law is only as effective as the authority that is backing it, then the law of faith is backed by the highest authority in the universe. The following scriptures show this to be true:

Numbers 23:19 “God is not a man, that He should lie,

Nor a son of man, that He should repent.

Has He said, and will He not do?

Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?

Isaiah 55:11 So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; It shall not return to Me void, But it shall accomplish what I please, And it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it.

2 Timothy 2:13 If we are faithless, He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself.

You don’t have to wonder whether God is going to back His word or not.

Psalm 138:2 ...For You have magnified Your word above all Your name.

One problem with any human legal system is the fact that people are involved. People can be manipulated or coerced to stray from the purpose of the system they pledged to uphold.

That is not a problem with God.

When God says something, He means it, and all of heaven backs it. That’s why Jesus told us to let our yes be yes, and our no be no. When you have God’s nature - your word becomes like His word - trustworthy.

It is our job to figure out the law. I wrote about that [here](https://pastorjeremiah.com/the-law-of-faith). A lawyer spends years studying the workings of the law, and the more experience they get - they can eventually master the functions of the law.

In the same way, we study God’s law (the bible) and can become masters of it.

Once you have an understanding of the law, you are able to operate by it and even enforce it.

In John 10:10 Jesus describes the role of the devil as the thief - he comes to steal, kill, and destroy. In our world - that means he comes to break the law.

If somebody were to break in your home with the intentions of either hurting or stealing from you, you would enforce the law. Most likely you’d call the police, but if you don’t have time to wait for them you have the right to defend yourself.

It is the nature of a criminal to break the law. The devil is a criminal - so don’t expect him to play fair.

Just like you would do whatever it takes to expel a criminal from your home - using as much force as necessary - treat the devil with the same attitude.

When sickness, disease, poverty, oppression, depression, bondage, or any other attack of the devil tries to break into your life - take violent force against it! Use the name of Jesus - the most powerful name (Philippians 2:10), and put the devil on the run!
