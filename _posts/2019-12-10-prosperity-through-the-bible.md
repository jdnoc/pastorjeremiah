I'm just writing about scriptures from the Bible start to finish - Genesis to Revelation on the subject of prosperity. I'm pretty much doing this for myself. I like to do these kind of studies for a variety of subjects. I figured I'd put them on my website so that anybody can read them. I'm not trying to convince you of anything - like I said, I'm writing for me. (In the content below when I say "you" that's just the fictional person that I'm having this dialogue with to get my thoughts down)

Genesis 1:

> 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

Everything was created by God. It's all His stuff. It can be a big deal for people to tithe, or to give offerings above the tithe, but considering the fact that He created _everything_, it shouldn't be a problem.

If somebody gave me a house, a car, clothes, food, and everything else that I own, I would want to give back to that person. I would want to bless them, and repay them for their kindness to me.

That's kind of what God did for us. He gave us a universe - with everything that we need in it to live and be happy. There has been no stop to the innovation that people have be able to create since we were made. All of that innovation was made with His stuff - the stuff that He made the planets and the universe with.

The house you live in is made with materials he put on this earth. The metals and plastics that make the computer I'm typing with - are made of compounds created of materials that He put in the Earth.

He made everything - and put us in charge of it, so it shouldn't be so hard to give back to Him.

What does this verse have to do with giving? It doesn't, giving comes later - I'm just jumping ahead. But perhaps you're already somewhere ahead in the Bible reading about giving - and you're wondering why we should give. This verse is just one reason - God made it all.

> Genesis 1:3 Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.

God _said._ In this first chapter of the Bible we see God _creating_ everything that we see all around us with **words**.

Since the Bible is our road map to success (Joshua 1:8) perhaps we should note how God created _everything_. I want to create a bunch of stuff in my life too. Creating sweet stuff is probably one of the most enjoyable things we can do in life.

Different people might consider different things to be their "sweet stuff" they want to create. It could be children (even better: well behaved children). What does that have to do with speaking? Try making a child without communicating with somebody else.

Try making a well behaved child without communicating with them. The way we talk to and about our children will have a huge effect on how they turn out.

We can also create prosperity with our words. You might think that's a stretch. Have you ever met somebody that talked poor that was wealthy?

Now you might be thinking about some stingy old man that you knew that looked completely broke but when he passed away you found out he was a millionaire (or saw an article in the news like that). I would argue that despite the money he had in his bank account - he was still poor.

Poor is a mindset. Thinking and acting poor doesn't always change when you have more money.

More than likely the people that are really succeeding are talking success. The ones that are growing prosperous are thinking and talking prosperous.

People that aren't pulling ahead in life - seem to always be talking about how they aren't pulling ahead.

Some people have a problem with believing God for success and prosperity.

I think middle class Americans that are against the idea of prosperity is ungodly are hilarious. They would be considered extremely wealthy in many countries of the world living their lifestyle.

Heating, air conditioning, indoor plumbing (toilets in your house), a car to drive, an apartment or house to live in - even modestly furnished according to American standards, electricity, internet, clean reliable water. These are things that most of us take for granted - that many people in poor nations will never have. I know this from traveling to Haiti.

So just by having those things - you're considered wealthy to many people in the world. 

Prosperity is a lot about perspective.

To a multimillionaire - the average middle class living standards might seem poor. 

So who is to say when somebody is actually prosperous?

To the old multimillionaire that has no wife or children, perhaps a young family with wonderful children might seem prosperous. Perspective is different for everyone.

I want everyone to prosper (3 john 2), and for you that might mean something a little different than for me. I don't think we should begrudge anybody their desire to prosper. 

You will have a really hard time creating prosperity, unless you can learn to see yourself prospering - and speaking prosperity.

You can create too - with your words, just like God did. (see also verses: 6, 9, 11, 14, 20, 24, 26)

> 26 Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” 27 So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. 28 Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”

God created us to be like Him. In His image _and_ likeness. He also gave man dominion over all the animals.

God is our creator - we are his workmanship (Eph. 2:10). Everything that he created was _very good_ (see below).

God created us in His image and likeness and created us "very good" and gave us dominion over the creation and blessed us and commanded us to be _fruitful..._ I don't think He could have set us up for success any better.

We are acting like God when we are creating our world around us with our words. We are being obedient to God when we are being fruitful - when we are producing.

God loves producers! _And_ _has a lot of bad things to say about laziness_.

Jesus gave many illustrations of being fruitful - producing. (Luke 6:46-49, Luke 8:5-8, Luke 19:12–19:27). 

What are you producing? What fruit is all around you? 

I'm not talking about trials that may come your way from time to time. Those will come, but as you fight the good fight of faith - you will be victorious over them.

I'm talking about what are you setting your hand to - what are you doing in life that is producing good fruit? The words that are coming out of your mouth - if you were to have exactly what you say - would you want it?

God wants you to take dominion - not be under dominion. He doesn't want you suffering under poverty! He wants you to be free!

> 31 Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

**Everything** God makes is _very_ good! That is including you!

If you are created to be like Him, then you should be creating something very good as well!
