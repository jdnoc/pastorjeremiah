Genesis 2:

> 8 The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed. 9 And out of the ground the Lord God made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. 

The garden of Eden - also known as the Garden of God. This was a place where God and man were able to walk together (see Gen. 3:8). This place was where man could freely be in God's presence. The intended environment for man to live in by its creator - is in the presence of God.

In the place - the presence of God - man had all that he needed. He was sustained by the the fruit of the vegetation that was found in the garden.

We don't know exactly how big the garden of Eden was - but if you look at Gen. 2:10-14 it says a river went out from the garden and become 4 rivers. You can look at those 4 rivers on a map today, and see that they covered much of the Middle East. I think it's safe to assume that it was a very big garden.

Life in the garden was God's original intention for His creation. For man to dwell freely in His presence, with no sense of sin, and being sustained by all the creation round about him.

You probably know the rest of the story... man sins and is removed from the garden. From that time until now God has been working a plan to bring man back into His presence. Today we are much closer to the culmination of this plan than Adam & Eve, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David and other old testament men and women.

We see the progressive plan of how God made covenants with man to allow them to walk closer to Him. Through the finished work of Jesus (His death, burial, and resurrection) man has been able to walk even closer with God. His presence (since the day of Pentecost) now can freely dwell in all of God's people like He hadn't been able to in thousands of years.

The completion of God's plan will be us ruling and reigning with Him in His new kingdom. We will once again be restored to the very state that Adam was in when He was in the Garden. Walking freely in the presence of God, completely sustained by Him, and no sin or even recollection of having sinned.

To some extent we can experience that now. We have the Holy Spirit living in us and can even be baptized (immersed) into His presence. We have become brand new creation's in Christ and the old has passed away - all things are made new. We can walk and believe God for miracles of supernatural provision and health.

The difference is that now we have to do all that by fighting the good fight of faith. When Jesus returns for His bride - the church - we will no longer have to fight to stay in faith. We won't have to strive against the flesh (senses) or carnal nature, we won't have to believe God for healing, divine health, or financial prosperity. We'll simply live in it and with it.

That's great for _then_, what about _now?_

We're as close to the completion of God's plan as we can get. Hebrews 8:6 tells us that we are in a better covenant that is established on better promises. This better covenant is in contrast to the old covenant (testament).

Yet even under the old covenant - we'll see as we go through it that when God's people walked in obedience to Him and His instruction, the were financially prosperous, healthy, and fruitful.

If under the older (worse/lesser) covenant the people of God walked in financial prosperity (among many other blessings) then how much more should we walk in it.

This doesn't go contrary to God's plan. Religion teaches that God's plan is for us to stay humble. For some reason "humility" has to do with being financially poor. Yet that is moving in the opposite direction of what God is trying to do.

Remember God's plan is to bring us back to the place where we can freely dwell in His presence and to be sustained completely by Him. We shouldn't lack any good thing! (Psalm 34:10, Matthew 6:25-33)

Man had no need in God's presence.

Man had everything he needed in God's presence.

Man had more than enough in God's presence.

Everywhere that man looked in the garden of God, there was provision for him. "And out of the ground the Lord God made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food"

That's where God wants us to dwell.

> 15 Then the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend and keep it.

Man had a job. He had instruction from God and a role to fulfill.

You were created with purpose. You have instruction from God and a role to fulfill. You're not going to live the abundant life that God intends for you to live while being lazy.

Notice that even while man was in the garden of God - in His presence, where all His needs were met for him by God's creation... He still had to work.

Some ultra spiritual Christian's get the notion that they can "live by faith" and use that as an excuse to do nothing.

Now your job might be a stay at home mom. To anybody that doesn't think that's work, just go ahead and try it yourself. (Actually you probably shouldn't do that, unless they are your own children... you might get sent away if you try it)  But you know what I mean.

Your job might be studying in college. Your job might be making youtube content. You might have a "traditional" job. The job doesn't really matter (other than making sure you're doing what God wants you to do). What matters is that you're doing something, working to fulfill your purpose. The men and women that God worked with in the Bible were people of action.

Somebody might object and say my job is to pray. Great! Then you better actually be praying 8+ hours a day, not just sitting around thinking "spiritual thoughts" and writing them in your journal. You better be seeing fruit from your prayer. If you have ever prayed for a 8 hours or more in a day, you realized pretty quick that it's not "fun" but that it takes effort and putting the flesh under.

The issue is when people are trying to blame their laziness on their "spirituality"... If you're spending time in prayer, God's word, or any other aspect of the Christian life as a full time career, then there will be much fruit from it!

As you work in whatever you are doing (with a christian work ethic - we'll come to that later), you will see God's hand of provision on your life.
