## God Promises Us Rest

> Matthew 11:28 Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 29 Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”

People all around the world are carrying heavy loads.

You can see it on their faces, you can hear it in their voices. They aren’t free. They are suffering. They are weighed down by a many different things.

What are some of these burdens that people are carrying?

### Religion

You might find it interesting to be reading a Christian article and at the first item on the list for unnecessary burdens is religion. The truth is that Christianity is not a religion, it’s a relationship. If you haven’t yet experienced this, let me explain by using Jesus example.

When Jesus was alive during his 3½ years of ministry there were many different groups and classes of people in the culture. From men to women, rich to poor, healthy to sick, social outcasts, sinners, foreigners, Jesus ministered to just about everybody. Yet there was one group of people that Jesus constantly rebuked and criticized.

_The religious people._

Pharisees, sadducees, scribes, rulers of the law. These were the religious leaders of the day, they were the ones that gave Jesus the hardest time.

One of Jesus’ favorite terms for these religious folk was “hypocrites”. Whole portions of scripture is devoted to Jesus’ warnings against these people.

Perhaps one sentence that Jesus said summarizes their religious practices: Matthew 23:4 For they bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.

Religion is a burden. It’s a heavy load. It’s a system of rules, regulations, laws that are attempting to reach God by works, but there is no lasting freedom there.

**Religion is man’s attempt to become righteous.**

There is only one way to become righteous - and that is through blood of Jesus that was shed as the perfect sacrifice for our sins. It’s nothing that you can earn, rather it’s something that you accept. It is God’s free gift to us, and it is received by faith in Jesus.

This is what makes religion so tough. Whether it’s religion within Christianity (there’s plenty of that) or other religions. Religion requires you to _do something_ in order to become _worthy_ of God. Whether it’s physical suffering or self mutilation, a vow of poverty, a vow of silence, an act of terrorism, performing religious ceremonies, the list goes on for what men require others to do in order to be deemed worthy of God.

I share the gospel with many people. I’ve found the ones that resist the message of Jesus the most are the ones that have been hurt by religion.

Perhaps the worst part about this, is that many of those people were genuinely seeking God and were misguided by other people into religion. Due to their sincere desire to find something beyond themselves they are  often willing to accept the systems of religion that man has put in place. Other people are born into their religion and that’s what they do because it’s what they’ve always done.

**A relationship with Jesus is totally different**. When you come to Jesus, He sets you free from the bondage of sin simply because you believe in Him and confess that he is your Lord. It’s not based on how worthy you are. Your own righteousness is as filthy rags. Yet when you become a believer in Jesus, you are made righteous based on what _He_ has done.

If you’ve been burned by religion, it’s time to take that weight off your shoulders, and receive rest from Jesus.

## **Sin**

Anger, unforgiveness, gossip, addiction, substance abuse, sexual immorality, the list goes on. Galatians 5:19-21 gives a long list of sinful behaviors.

An accurate expression of sin is found within Hebrews 11:25… “enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season”.

Sin is pleasurable for a season. Jesus told the story of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32). The young man went out into the world and spent all that he had on sinful living, and for a time it was fun and pleasurable.

Sin doesn’t stay pleasurable. _It will eventually turn on you, and betray you_. **It will kill you, if you let it**. James 1:13-15 talks about temptation and concludes with this statement “sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.”

The devil cleverly lures people into sinful living, then once they have fallen he kicks them while they are down with guilt and condemnation. Once this guilt and shame sets in, people don’t feel worthy to come to God, so they stay away from Him.

Yet He alone has the power to remove this burden of sin.

> Psalm 103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.

East and west never meet, they just keep going away from each other infinitely. You can travel as far east as you want without ever going west. Yet if you travel north, eventually you’ll reach the north pole, cross over and start heading south.

When God removes our sins from us, that’s how he does it - he takes them infinitely away.

If you’ve ever messed up after you got saved, that’s what 1 John 1:9 is for “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”

Put your faith in Jesus, repent for your sin, and let him remove that burden off of your shoulders.

When God sets you free from sin, not only does He remove the weight of it, **but He also gives you the power to stay free from it**.

> Romans 6:22 But now having been set free from sin, and having become slaves of God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end, everlasting life.

> 1 Corinthians 10:13 No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it.

> Hebrews 12:1 Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us

#### There’s many other burdens that we could discuss.

* Hurt and Pain
* Broken relationships
* Sickness and disease
* Financial burdens

Those are just a few on a long list of possible struggles.

The bottom line is this: no matter what the issue that you’ve been carrying in life, Jesus wants to give you rest from it.

You don’t need to carry it anymore. Give it to Him, and He will set you free.

> 1 Peter 5:7 casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.

> Psalm 55:22 Cast your burden on the Lord, and He shall sustain you; He shall never permit the righteous to be moved.

When you do what the psalmist says, and cast your burden on the Lord, then you don’t have that burden anymore.

#### You will have rest.
